  introduction: `Up to now you've shaped your voice (how you sound) and your product position (where you stand). Now it's time to make your brand recognizable in the wild. Week 3 is about naming, handles, and the visual starter kit — the surface-level cues people remember and repeat.

Think of this like choosing the outfit your brand will walk into the party wearing. Does it fit? Is it memorable? Does it start conversations? That's what we're building here.`,

You're not looking for something "safe." You're looking for something that feels alive in your voice, speaks to your audience, and can stretch across contexts. Don't stop at the first clever idea — push until you've got 15 strong contenders.`,

My brand voice: [insert your brand voice/archetype]
My target audience: [describe who you serve]
My core offering: [what you do/sell]
My Strategy Seal: [your 5-7 word distinction]

Generate 15 name options that:
1. Sound like my brand voice
2. Are memorable and easy to say
3. Could work across different contexts
4. Avoid generic business terms
5. Have personality and energy

For each name, include a one-line explanation of why it fits my brand.

For each name candidate, suggest:
1. Domain variations (.com, .co, .io, etc.)
2. Social media handle options
3. Email handle possibilities
4. Backup variations if main options are taken

Check for:
- Easy to type and remember
- Sounds like my brand when spoken
- Works across platforms
- Professional but personality-driven

- Simple text-based marks I can use anywhere
- Bullet point alternatives
- Section dividers
- Signature elements

**Icon Concepts (3 ideas):**
- Simple visual concepts that could become logos
- Geometric shapes that represent my brand
- Symbolic representations of my work

For each symbol, explain why it connects to my brand and how I could use it.
