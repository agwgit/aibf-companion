  introduction: `Your audience won't read your deck before they see your colors, your type, your imagery. Visuals speak before words. Week 4 is about locking in a consistent design language so that anywhere your brand shows up — on a website, in a deck, on a post — people know it's you.

Think of this as setting the wardrobe, color grading, and cinematography for your brand's movie. The details you define here will ripple through every touchpoint that follows.`,
